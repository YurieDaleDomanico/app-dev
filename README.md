| Peaky Blinders | Britain is a mixture of despair and hedonism in 1919 in the aftermath of the Great War. Returning soldiers, newly minted revolutions and criminal gangs are fighting for survival in a nation rocked by economic upheaval. One of the most powerful gangs of the time is the Peaky Blinders, run by returning war hero Thomas Shelby and his family. But Thomas has bigger ambitions than just running the streets. When a crate of guns goes missing, he recognizes an opportunity to advance in the world because crime may pay but legitimate business pays better. Trying to rid Britain of its crime is Inspector Chester Campbell, who arrives from Belfast to try to achieve that goal. | 
| Narcos | The true story of Colombia's infamously violent and powerful drug cartels fuels this gritty gangster drama series. Won Best TV Drama Series and Best TV Ensemble Cast at Mexico's 2017 FÃ©nix Awards.|
| Superwog| The Superwog series follows the often misunderstood, dysfunctional Superwog family as they struggle to navigate life in the Australian suburbs. Superwog is a girls and fast food-obsessed teenager enrolled in a prestigious private school. |
